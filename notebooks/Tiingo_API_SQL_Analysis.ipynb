    "1.  **`gics_sector`**:\n",
    "    *   **Definition:** The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sector name. This broadly categorizes companies based on their primary business activity.\n",
    "    *   **Example:** 'Real Estate', 'Financials', 'Energy'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`year`**:\n",
    "    *   **Definition:** The calendar year for which the `current_volatility` metric was calculated. In this table, it's specifically 2020.\n",
    "    *   **Example:** 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **`num_stocks`**:\n",
    "    *   **Definition:** The number of distinct companies within that `gics_sector` that had sufficient data available in the database to be included in the volatility calculation for the specified `year` (2020).\n",
    "    *   **Example:** 31 (for Real Estate in 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **`current_volatility`**:\n",
    "    *   **Definition:** The calculated annualized volatility of the sector's daily returns for the specified `year` (2020). It's typically calculated as the standard deviation of the sector's average daily returns, multiplied by the square root of the number of trading days in a year (commonly √252). A higher value indicates greater price fluctuation or risk during that year.\n",
    "    *   **Example:** 0.5258 (or 56.94%) for Real Estate in 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **`prev_year_volatility`**:\n",
    "    *   **Definition:** The calculated annualized volatility of the sector's daily returns for the year *prior* to the specified `year`. In this case, it represents the volatility for 2019.\n",
    "    *   **Example:** 0.1816 (or 18.16%) for Real Estate in 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **`volatility_change_pct`**:\n",
    "    *   **Definition:** The percentage change in annualized volatility from the previous year (2019) to the current year (2020). Calculated as `((current_volatility - prev_year_volatility) / prev_year_volatility) * 100`. This highlights the relative magnitude of the volatility increase or decrease.\n",
    "    *   **Example:** 213.50% for Real Estate, indicating its 2020 volatility was 213.50% higher than its 2019 volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **`volatility_change_abs`**:\n",
    "    *   **Definition:** The absolute difference in annualized volatility between the current year (2020) and the previous year (2019). Calculated as `current_volatility - prev_year_volatility`. This shows the raw change in the volatility measure.\n",

    "### Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight:\n",
    "The Real Estate sector experienced the most dramatic volatility increase in 2020, with a 213.50% surge from 2019 (0.1816) to 2020 (0.5694), coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. This was significantly higher than other sectors, even surpassing traditionally volatile sectors like Energy (153.62% increase) and Financials (156.61% increase). Notably, all sectors showed at least a 60% increase in volatility during this period, indicating a market-wide impact, but defensive sectors like Consumer Staples (69.74%) and Health Care (67.29%) demonstrated relatively more stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation:\n",
    "1. Risk managers and portfolio managers should implement enhanced monitoring systems for Real Estate exposure, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty or public health crises.\n",
    "2. Consider using Consumer Staples and Health Care sectors as potential volatility hedges, as they demonstrated the most resilience during the 2020 market turbulence (lowest volatility increases of 69.74% and 67.29% respectively).\n",
    "3. Develop sector-specific stress testing scenarios that account for the possibility of sudden volatility spikes similar to those seen in 2020, especially for sectors that showed extreme sensitivity (Real Estate, Financials, Energy).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction:\n",
    "While volatility levels are likely to normalize post-crisis, Real Estate sector volatility will remain sensitive to future public health or work-from-home related disruptions. The sector's dramatic response to COVID-19 (213.50% volatility increase) suggests it could experience similar outsized reactions to future events that impact physical occupancy rates or commercial property values. We may see elevated baseline volatility in Real Estate compared to pre-2020 levels as the sector continues to adapt to structural changes in how commercial and office spaces are utilized.\n"

    "### Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight:\n",
    "Retail and Health Care REITs experienced the most severe volatility in 2020, with Simon Property Group (SPG) showing the highest volatility (0.9159) among all Real Estate companies, nearly 2.5x higher than the sector's most stable company, Public Storage (0.3643). There's a clear pattern where property type significantly influenced volatility levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Most Volatile Sub-industries (>0.65 volatility):\n",
    "   - Retail REITs (SPG: 0.9159, KIM: 0.7586)\n",
    "   - Health Care REITs (VTR: 0.8427, WELL: 0.7478)\n",
    "   - Hotel & Resort REITs (HST: 0.6911)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Most Stable Sub-industries (<0.45 volatility):\n",
    "   - Self-Storage REITs (PSA: 0.3643, EXR: 0.4120)\n",
    "   - Data Center REITs (EQIX: 0.4054, DLR: 0.4333)\n",
    "   - Telecom Tower REITs (SBAC: 0.4257, CCI: 0.4258)\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern strongly correlates with each sub-industry's exposure to COVID-19 lockdown measures and social distancing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation:\n",
    "1. Portfolio managers should consider implementing a \"hybrid REIT\" strategy that balances:\n",
    "   - Digital Infrastructure REITs (Data Centers, Telecom Towers) for stability\n",
    "   - Traditional REITs (Retail, Healthcare) for recovery potential\n",
    "   - Industrial/Logistics REITs (like Prologis) for e-commerce exposure\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Risk managers should:\n",
    "   - Develop sub-industry specific risk metrics, as the performance gap between different REIT types (0.9159 vs 0.3643) suggests traditional sector-level diversification may be insufficient\n",
    "   - Increase monitoring of REITs with physical occupancy dependence\n",
    "   - Consider setting different risk limits for different REIT sub-categories\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction:\n",
    "The bifurcation between digital and physical real estate will likely persist:\n",
    "- Digital/Infrastructure REITs (Data Centers, Telecom Towers) will maintain lower volatility due to long-term contracts and essential service status\n",
    "- Traditional retail and healthcare REITs will face continued volatility as they adapt to hybrid operating models\n",
    "- Industrial/Logistics REITs will see steady growth with e-commerce expansion\n",
    "- The sector may see increased M&A activity as stronger REITs (particularly in digital/infrastructure) acquire distressed traditional property portfolios"
