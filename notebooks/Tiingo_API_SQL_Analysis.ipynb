    "1.  **`gics_sector`**:\n",
    "    *   **Definition:** The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sector name. This broadly categorizes companies based on their primary business activity.\n",
    "    *   **Example:** 'Real Estate', 'Financials', 'Energy'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`year`**:\n",
    "    *   **Definition:** The calendar year for which the `current_volatility` metric was calculated. In this table, it's specifically 2020.\n",
    "    *   **Example:** 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **`num_stocks`**:\n",
    "    *   **Definition:** The number of distinct companies within that `gics_sector` that had sufficient data available in the database to be included in the volatility calculation for the specified `year` (2020).\n",
    "    *   **Example:** 24 (for Real Estate in 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **`current_volatility`**:\n",
    "    *   **Definition:** The calculated annualized volatility of the sector's daily returns for the specified `year` (2020). It's typically calculated as the standard deviation of the sector's average daily returns, multiplied by the square root of the number of trading days in a year (commonly √252). A higher value indicates greater price fluctuation or risk during that year.\n",
    "    *   **Example:** 0.5258 (or 52.58%) for Real Estate in 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **`prev_year_volatility`**:\n",
    "    *   **Definition:** The calculated annualized volatility of the sector's daily returns for the year *prior* to the specified `year`. In this case, it represents the volatility for 2019.\n",
    "    *   **Example:** 0.1800 (or 18.00%) for Real Estate in 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **`volatility_change_pct`**:\n",
    "    *   **Definition:** The percentage change in annualized volatility from the previous year (2019) to the current year (2020). Calculated as `((current_volatility - prev_year_volatility) / prev_year_volatility) * 100`. This highlights the relative magnitude of the volatility increase or decrease.\n",
    "    *   **Example:** 192.17% for Real Estate, indicating its 2020 volatility was 192.17% higher than its 2019 volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **`volatility_change_abs`**:\n",
    "    *   **Definition:** The absolute difference in annualized volatility between the current year (2020) and the previous year (2019). Calculated as `current_volatility - prev_year_volatility`. This shows the raw change in the volatility measure.\n",
